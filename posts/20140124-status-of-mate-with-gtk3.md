GTK3 support adding in MATE is going on, almost all packages now build
with GTK3 flag enabled. There are still a lot of small things to fix,
but at least now we can have a running MATE session with latest GTK
library.

Here's a couple of screenshots posted some days ago by
[Sander Sweers](https://github.com/infirit/) on #mate-dev.

follow the status of MATE 1.7. Roadmap for 1.8 release is
