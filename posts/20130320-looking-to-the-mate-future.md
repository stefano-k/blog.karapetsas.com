There are a lot of things that we will implement in MATE Desktop releases after 1.6:

menta2

  * New exciting features, like window snapping in window manager, a plugin system for the file manager (currently extensions cant be enabled/disabled without restart Caja), epub support in document viewer…
  * Add option to use Metacity as default window manager (this is already possible, but we’ll support completely Metacity also in control center, workspaces names, etc.)
  * Support [GStreamer 1.0](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)
  * Support completely new features of [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd)
  * Support GTK3, keeping availability to build with GTK2
  * Support [Wayland](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/)
