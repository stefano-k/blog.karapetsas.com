This is a short list of some “success stories” for MATE Desktop that I know.

  * Some distributions include MATE Desktop officially (and some of them have a dedicated MATE edition too): [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/), [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/), [Sabayon](http://www.sabayon.org/) and [Salix OS](http://www.salixos.org/).
  * The [Physics Department of the Freie Universitaet Berlin](http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/en/) in Germany deploys MATE on their Debian Wheezy desktops for both students and employees.
  * Portuguese Insurance company [Tranquilidade](http://www.esop.pt/uploads/2012/09/TranquilidadeDesktopLinux.pdf) has planned to migrate to Ubuntu 12.04 and MATE Desktop on their offices.
  * Canadian [Legal Aid Manitoba](http://www.legalaid.mb.ca/) has planned to migrate to MATE Desktop 1.6 on their offices, and their [sysadmin](https://github.com/sbalneav) is helping on its development too.
  * [First Colo](http://www.first-colo.net/EN/), a German Datacenter, has planned to migrate to MATE Desktop, and donated us a dedicated server to support our development.
