Iâ€™m really happy to announce that [gnome-main-menu](http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME_Main_Menu)
will come back, adapted for MATE, with same name and with the source still on same location
on [git.gnome.org](http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-main-menu), as there is no reason to
fork it.

[Federico Mena Quintero](http://people.gnome.org/~federico/)
[accepted](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2012-November/msg00201.html)
the proposal of me and Nelson Marques to continue to maintain it for MATE.

The next gnome-main-menu version will come out together with MATE 1.6.
