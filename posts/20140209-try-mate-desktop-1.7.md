As usual during MATE development, when unstable tarballs are ready for users
testing, we prepare repositories and ask them to help us to make it ready
to become stable.

At the moment, there are guidelines for Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora,
Gentoo and Ubuntu in this [wiki page](http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/testing).
