We are rebuilding all packages from scratch switching to the upstream versioning schema
(YYYY.MM.DD instead of 1.0). In some days the repository will restart to have updates
(and bug fixing).

During this time, you can install mate-applets on wheezy installing libgucharmap7 of squeeze:

```
   libgucharmap7_2.30.3-1_i386.deb
   libgucharmap7_2.30.3-1_amd64.deb
```
