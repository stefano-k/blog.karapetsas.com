GTK3 support adding in MATE is going on, almost all packages now build
with GTK3 flag enabled. There are still a lot of small things to fix,
but at least now we can have a running MATE session with latest GTK

Here's a couple of screenshots posted some days ago by
(Sander Sweers)[https://github.com/infirit/] on #mate-dev.

1.8 release is (here)[].
